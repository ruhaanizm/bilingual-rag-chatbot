The Institute was\nrenamed Harcourt Butler Technological Institute in 1926 in honor of the name of Sir Spencer\nHarcourt Butler, the then Governor of U.P. Degree courses in Oil Technology were started in\n1921, and Chemical Engineering was started in 1954 and after that number of undergraduate\nand post graduate courses were started. On March 26, 1965, it was upgraded from a\nGovernment Department status to an Autonomous Institution. It was upgraded to Harcourt\nButler Technical University, Kanpur on September 01, 2016, by Govt. of UP. The University\nspreads across two campuses - East Campus (77 acres) and West Campus (271 acres)\nsituated approximately 3 kilometers apart. The University provides a congenial environment for\nthe holistic growth and all-round development of the students.\nABOUT THE SCHOOL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY\nUniversity offers distinctive study programs with its priority and thrust in imparting high-quality\neducation in seven Chemical Technology branches, namely Oil Technology (Estd. 1921),\nChemical Engineering (Estd. 1954), Plastic Technology (Estd. 1964), Paint Technology (Estd.\n1964), Food Technology (Estd. 1964), Bio-chemical Engineering (Estd. 1964) and Leather\nTechnology (Estd. 1978). The School of Chemical Technology (SoCT) produced more than 15,000\ngraduates in these programs which cater to the industry and top-level management human\nresource demands at the National and International level. Alumni from the School of Chemical\nTechnology are placed as CEOs/MD’s of many top Companies across the world.\nABOUT INDIAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS\nIndian Institute of Chemical Engineers (IIChE) was born on 18th May 1947 on the eve of\nthe Indian Independence. The Institute is the apex body of Chemical Engineering\nProfessionals in India. The activities of the Institute are spread across the country through\nits 42 Regional Centres and more than 170 student chapters.
