The\nancient higher education gave lots of thrust towards holistic\ndevelopment of the students imbibing in them not only technical\nknowledge but also creative skills, human values, cultural exposure,\nethics etc. The ancient education system has proven to be the best\neducation system in the world as at that time due to the education\nsystem prevalent in India, our country was called “Vishwa Guru” or\n“World Mentor”. Over the years, there have been many reforms in\nthe education system especially after the British colonial rule,\nwhen our education system felt a shift from ancient methods of\nlearning to practical methods of learning and especially in higher\neducation which is continuing till now. National Education Policy\n(NEP) 2020 is announced by the Government majorly to fulfil the\nparadigm shift in teaching-learning process with the main focus\ntowards making our country “World Mentor” and move towards building\na stronger foundation towards excellence and march towards meeting\nglobal standards. Further, towards holistic development of students\nby preparing them to be innovators, job providers rather than job\nseekers and finally preparing them to resolve societal/ social\nproblems as well as issues. All this cannot be achieved unless a\nstudent studies and understands different subjects which are offered\nto him/her under multidisciplinary section. In this light Harcourt\nButler Technical University, Kanpur (HBTU, Kanpur) has implemented\nNEP 2020 from its academic session 2022-2023 at the undergraduate\nlevel. The students are offered various subjects which have\ninterdepartmental credits. The main highlight being, the student of\n4th year B.Tech. program completing courses with 20 or more\nadditional credits in the area other than their branch of study (for\nexample a Mechanical Engineering B.Tech. student if students 20 or\nmore credits of Computer Science & Engineering with a specialization\nPage 6/66 27-01-2025 09:50:19\nAnnual Quality Assurance Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\ntowards Internet of Things) will be awarded degree of B.Tech. with\nmajor in their branch of study along with minor degree of\nspecialization of additional courses (for example B.Tech. in\nMechanical Engineering with minor degree in Internet of Things).\nHBTU., Kanpur is committed to revise all other programs based on NEP\n2020 from next Academic Session, 2023-24 and give its students a\ncompetitive environment in terms of teaching and learning.\n17.Academic bank of credits (ABC):\nThe academic bank credit has been prepared by the U.P government and\nHarcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur will in due course of\ntime implement and adopt credit transfer system as per the\nguidelines laid down by Higher Education Department and how the\nstudents will be benefitted from it. HBTU., Kanpur is amongst the\ntop Univerities to have adopted NEP 2020 from the Academic Session,\n2022-23. The system offers extreme flexibility to the students. Any\nstudent leaving the University after completion of 1st Year B.Tech.\nprogram will be awarded Certificate of Engineering & Technology\n(so that the student is still employable), any student after\ncompleting 2nd Year will be awarded Diploma in the relevant branch\nof study and so on and so forth. Not only this, the possibility of\nstudent re enrolling in the University after some gap of few years\nand completing her/ his rest of the credits to get the degree will\nbe explored and implemented from coming Academic Sessions. Also, the\nstudent of 4th year B.Tech. program completing courses with 20 or\nmore additional credits in the area other than their branch of study\nwill be awarded degree of B.Tech. with major in their branch of\nstudy along with minor degree of specialization of additional\ncourses. The aim is to provide students to undertake inter\ndisciplinary courses. Interdisciplinary approach enables integration\nof concepts, theories, techniques, and perspectives from two or more\ndisciplines to advance fundamental understanding or to solve\nproblems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline\nand further make the students more employable.\n18.Skill development:\nHarcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur (erstwhile HBTI,\nKanpur) was established in 1921 to provide technical know how to\nnascent industries in the region.
