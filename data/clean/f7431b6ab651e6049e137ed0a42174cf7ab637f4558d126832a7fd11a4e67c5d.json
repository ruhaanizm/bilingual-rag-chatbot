Mission statements of an organization describe the objectives of the\norganization and their requisitions. Mission usually includes action-oriented statements.\nThe process of formulation of vision and mission of HBTU, Kanpur includes various stages of brainstorming,\nrigorous exercise of what we are and where we want to move from here and discussions with all the\nstakeholders. The following stages explain formulation of the Vision and Mission statements of HBTU,\nKanpur\nStep 1: Analyzing previous vision and mission of Institute (HBTI)\nStep 2: Underlying the objectives and purpose of university formation mentioned in HBTU Act 2016\nStep 3: Meeting and discussions with all stakeholders of the university (Alumni, Industry Students, Faculty and\nadministrative people)\nStep 4: Draft of Vision and Mission Statements\nStep 5: Discussions with faculty and HODs of University for suggestions\nStep 6: Incorporation of necessary suggestions in the Vision statement and Mission statements draft\nStep 7: Meeting with Vice Chancellor, Pro-Vice Chancellor, Registrar, Deans and HODs of University to\nfinalize vision statement and mission statements\nStep 8: Approval of Final Vision and Mission of University by Hon'ble Vice Chancellor of University\n1.2 Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Challenges(SWOC)\nInstitutional Strength\nDiversity in Technical Courses: Harcourt Butler Technological Institute, Kanpur (HBTI., Kanpur) was\nestablished in 1921 and was upgraded to University in 2016 which comprises of four schools viz. School of\nEngineering (SoE), School of Chemical Technology (SoCT), School of Basic and Applied Sciences (SoBAS)\nand School of Humanities and Social Sciences (SoHSS). The SoE and SoCT provide 13 Under Graduate degree\nprogrammes in Engineering and Technology alongwith education in Post-Graduation and Doctoral degrees.\nThe SoBAS supports the B.Tech. and M.Tech. programmes and provides Post Graduation (M.Sc.- Physics,\nM.Sc.-Chemistry and M.Sc.-Mathematics) and doctoral degree programmes. The SoHSS also supports the\nB.Tech. and M.Tech. programmes and provides Under Graduation (BBA) and Post- Graduation (MBA) along\nwith doctoral degree programmes.\nImplementation of National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) in course curriculum: The University has\nadopted NEP 2020 from the Academic Session, 2022-2023 which indicates its readiness to adopt innovative\nchanges and this also reflects its institutional strength.\nInclusiveness and Diversity: The University has conducive environment for students, faculty members and\nstaff members who are socially and economically diversified and come from different areas. This has helped\nPage 4/131 22-01-2023 05:45:26\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nthe University to adopt good ideas and opinions from diversified areas and create a multicultural atmosphere.\nStudent Centric University: The University has a full-fledged office of the Dean Students Welfare which\nlooks after all the needs of the students. During the induction program of the new entrants all the students are\nattached to faculty mentors under the Mentor-Mentee concept which helps the new students to adapt to new\natmosphere. The student feedback system is in place and University Students Activity Council (USAC) takes\ncare of extracurricular activities and also provide them a platform to showcase and enhance their inherent\ntalents. After analyzing the feedback of all the stakeholders, the syllabi of all the programmes are updated at\nregular intervals through Board of Studies (BoS) meetings. Moreover, students are free to meet various\nadministrative heads and higher ups which helps in creating student friendly environment in the campus.\nThe University has well equipped Central Library named Tagore Central library which has 83,479 books and\n24,290 book titles, 843 e-books subscriptions and 53982 e-journals with full text subscription which can be\neasily accessed by the students, staff and faculty members. The University also has a dedicated gymnasium\nalong with outdoor and indoor sports facilities.\nInstitutional Weakness\nHarcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur is a state University governed by U.P. State Universities Act -\n2016. As a matter of fact, the State Government has a very important role in the development and decision\nmaking of the University. The grants received from the Government are limited and this has resulted in\ninadequate funds for developmental activities. This University, despite being one of the longest serving\nUniversity/Institute in the Country has been given limited grants in the past as well as at present also. Further, it\nis imperative to mention that, in a state like Uttar Pradesh, most of the population (approximately 70%) belongs\nto rural background and having less resources/paying capacity, therefore it is difficult to increase the fees for\nfinancial empowerment. The University has recently increased the intake of students and based on Faculty\nStudent Ratio (FSR) it has submitted the proposal for increase in sanctioned strength of faculty and staff.\nHowever, University is still waiting to get concurrence from the state government. This in turn is affecting the\ngrowth of University as it is not able to widen its regular faculty base and therefore it is facing difficulty in\ndiversifying research avenues. The University depends on state government for approval and implementation of\nvarious regulations as pronounced by different central regulatory bodies. Recently, 44 new faculty members\nhave joined the University, however, the proposal for the sanction of new faculty positions is already in\nconsideration with the state government. Sanction of new faculty positions will help strengthening teaching-\nlearning process and research. The University has also received grants/funds from various government schemes\nfor academic and infrastructure development. There has always been a time lag in implementation of such\nschemes and regulations, this in turn causes delay in the release of grants and thus slows down the growth.\nMaintenance of old buildings (100 years) with small maintenance grant is becoming very difficult at the\nUniversity.\nInstitutional Opportunity\nKanpur is the biggest city of the state and is the main center of commercial and industrial activities. Formerly it\nwas known as the Manchester of India. Now it is the commercial capital of Uttar Pradesh. HBTU, Kanpur\nformerly known as HBTI is an institute with more than 100 years of legacy and has seen the ups and downs of\nthe city. The University strives to revive the lost glory of the city in terms of business avenues. Further, the\npresence of industries in nearby areas has given an opportunity to the faculty members and students to work on\nPage 5/131 22-01-2023 05:45:27\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nindustrial problems and provide solutions to them. Each year since past 100 years, the graduates have become\nsuccessful entrepreneurs and leaders in various companies both in private and government sectors. Thousands\nof alumni of HBTU have been in top notch positions in all walks of life across the world and have always\nshown willingness to handhold the students of their alma mater. As they are equipped with adequate technology\nand science background to make breakthroughs, the HBTU graduates are prepared for better placements, paid\ninternships and entrepreneurship capabilities with the help of alumni. The faculty members have a strong\ninteraction with the alumni, which in turn helps in strengthening the course syllabus as per the need and\nchanges in the professional world. The University has IIT, Kanpur in the vicinity and this has facilitated the\nfaculty members to mutually get involved in the research and extension activities with the premium institute.\nFurther, the University Students Activity Council (USAC) helps in strengthening inherent talents of the\nstudents, all the departments either have their own technical associations or are linked with some professional\nbodies in respective domain areas. Departments regularly organizes National/International Conferences with the\nhelp of these associations, providing opportunity to the students to interact with experts and professionals in\ntheir respective fields which helps in inculcating professionalism and team spirit in the students. The University\nstrictly abides by the reservation policies of the state and also promotes gender-sensitive environment by\nconducting gender related programs in the University frequently.\nInstitutional Challenge\nThe state of Uttar Pradesh has many reputed technical institutions both government and private in nearby areas\nand therefore HBTU, Kanpur has an inherent challenge to perform better to attract good students, faculty and\nstaff. Further, the University has a large student base and creating a quality infrastructure and facilities as per\nglobal standards becomes a big challenge due to limited inflow of funds from the state government. Being a\npremier State Government Technical University, it caters to students from diverse socio-cultural-economic\nbackgrounds. The University in turn has a challenge to impart quality education at a reasonable fee structure to\nthe students from affluent as well as economically weaker backgrounds from both rural and urban settings. In\norder to provide quality education to such a diverse student background, the University has to assess the\nlearning levels of the students after admission at various stages.This activity is already in place in the\nUniversity which is a challenging task. Another, important concern for any Higher Education Institute (HEI) is\nto dessiminate Outcome Based Education (OBE) to ensure that all students are equipped with the knowledge,\ncompetence, and attributes needed to be successful when they exit after obtaining the degree. For continuous\nand sustainable transformation of traditional teaching-learning process to skill base education/latest pedagogy is\none of the crucial aspect of the University in order to meet the latest advancements in outcome based teaching-\nlearning process adressing to constant changes from time to time which is a challenging task. Another concern\nfor faculty members is to sustain quality research supported by patents/ quality publications/ research projects\nin various diversified areas as well as undertaking research, catering to social issues along with starting Centers\nof Excellence in various disciplines in collaboration with industry. Further, it is worth mentioning that\nUniversity celebrated its centenary year in 2021-22 and is trying to get funds from various schemes from\nCentral/ State government. This would definitely improve the financial health as well as provide greater\nopportunities to serve the nation. The curriculum of all programs have been upgraded in line of implementing\nthe National Education Policy – 2020 (NEP-2020). The University has dedicated faculty and very strong alumni\nbase and therefore is optimistic to convert its challenges into strength and serve the nation for greater cause.\n1.3 CRITERIA WISE SUMMARY\nPage 6/131 22-01-2023 05:45:27\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nCurricular Aspects\nHBTU, Kanpur caters to the needs of industry and the society by continuously updating its curriculum in order\nto keep pace with rapid changes in the technology.

To promote\nenvironmental awareness and sensitization about efficient use of energy resources and to identify energy saving\nopportunities, University regularly conducts green, environmental and energy audits.\nTo support differently-abled students, staff and faculty members, University created a friendly atmosphere by\nproviding physical facilities like wheelchairs, ramp/ lift facilities for easy access, divyangjan friendly\nwashrooms etc. The University has taken all possible initiatives in providing an inclusive environment towards\ncultural, regional, linguistic, socioeconomic and other such diversities through induction programs, fresher\nfunctions, cultural and technical fests, sports events, speeches, skits, personality development workshops,\nvarious philanthropic activities etc. under the umbrella of DSW. The University organizes events for raising\nconsciousness about national identity, fundamental rights, duties and other constitutional obligations.\nUniversity commemorates the birth and death anniversaries of great figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. B.R.\nAmbedkar, Swami Vivekananda etc. and also important days and festivals like Independence Day, Republic\nDay, International Yoga Day, Holi, Deepawali, Lohri, Christmas, Eid etc. The University has a well defined\n“Code of Conduct” for students and employees which is displayed on the website and also organizes various\nprofessional ethics and awareness programs.\nAmongst the best practice the university has two innovative practices. Alumni Student-support for Placements,\nInternships, Research and Entrepreneurship [ASPIRE] with the objective to develop an ecosystem which fosters\nbetter paid internship programs, enhances entrepreneurship abilities and provides better placement opportunities\nwith the help of Alumni Student Connect Programs (ASCPs). The other one is Social Activities for Women\nEmpowerment in Rural Areas [SAWERA] so that our students can inculcate a strong sense of social\nresponsibility catering to women empowerment in rural areas. Further, University offers B.Tech., M.Tech. and\nPh.D. programmes in distinctive Chemical Technology branches (Paint, Plastic, Leather, Biochemical, Food\nand Oil Technology) that are rare nationally/ internationally and niche in nature.\nPage 12/131 22-01-2023 05:45:27\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\n2.

Appropriate integration of Indian Knowledge Multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary\nsystem (teaching in Indian Language, culture, using teaching/learning used in ancient Indian Education\nPage 22/131 22-01-2023 05:45:27\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nonline course): System gave lots of thrust towards holistic\ndevelopment of students and to equip them with\ntechnical knowledge along with creative skills,\nhuman values, culture, ethics etc. The concept of\n‘meaningful life’ that has been the goal of Indian\nknowledge system seems to be missing now in\nmainstream education of modern era. This change of\ndirection necessitates complete integration of Indian\nKnowledge System with nation’s Education. The\nvery aim of Education shall have three outcomes as\ncharacteristics in graduates: Creation of New\nKnowledge, Wisdom to use the right knowledge in\nright time and place for right purpose, and the skill\nsets to get the proper results of knowledge in real life.\nThese outcomes are possible only when the Indian\nEducation System is properly balanced with the\nintegration of knowledge and skills in the new\neducation system. In Indian Knowledge System there\nhas been a vast repository of knowledge available in\nall native Indian languages but has remained\nunexplored for the last several decades. It\nencompasses the Foundational knowledge, Science,\nEngineering & Technology, Humanities & Social\nSciences and has a wide range of several beaches\nsuch as Astronomy, Health and Well-being,\nMathematics and Computing, Languages and\nLinguistics, Metallurgy, Rasa-Shastra, Public\nAdministration, War Technology, Management\nSciences and many more. It is the need of today’s\nworld to integrate the IKS into the contemporary\nknowledge in harmonious ways that would involve\nthe basic introduction to IKS, amalgamation of\nfundamental IKS concepts into the modern textbooks,\nand finally developing Indian Thought Models based\non available IKS literature, and their application into\nvarious contemporary problem solving methods. In\nthe context of IKS based education, Indian\nLanguages play a very crucial role. A judicious\nbalance of IKS and Indian Language education, be\nmade part of Indian Education to achieve the main\nobjective of NEP2020 to develop a holistic\neducation. The goal of National Education Policy\n(NEP) 2020 can be achieved through holistic\ndevelopment of students by preparing them to be\ninnovators, job providers and finally preparing them\nto be capable of resolving the issues of social\nproblems. HBTU Kanpur has, therefore, implemented\nNEP 2020 w.e.f. academic session 2022-2023 at the\nPage 23/131 22-01-2023 05:45:28\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nundergraduate level. The students are offered various\nsubjects having interdepartmental credits. The\nUniversity’s Vision and Mission majorly addresses\nto societal needs through technical solutions and\ninnovations. The University is fully committed\ntowards developing an understanding amongst our\nstudents to inculcate Indian Knowledge System, as\noutlined above. The University offers various core\nand audit courses. Also, many awareness programs\nare organized with focus on gender sensitization,\nblood donation, tree plantation, global warming,\nwomen security & education, women legal rights,\nmenstrual problems in women, women feticide, child\nmarriage, dowry, electoral rights importance and\nawareness etc. The University is also committed to\nimparting valuable knowledge to students through\nonline courses by duly implementing it in its\ncurriculum through the list of open elective courses\nas well as some elective courses wherever applicable\nas part of NEP 2020 from coming Academic\nSessions.\n5. Focus on Outcome based education (OBE): University has implemented OBE based curriculum,\ndelivery and assessment process to ensure the\neffective teaching and learning. Curriculum is\noriented towards fulfilling the local, national,\nregional and global developmental needs of the\nsociety at large and it is specifically designed\naccording to the OBE framework to ensure\nattainment of the POs and PSOs and have due focus\non employability / entrepreneurship / skill\ndevelopment through Choice Based Credit System\n(CBCS) / Buckets of Elective Courses. Curriculum\nincludes courses on Engineering fundamentals,\nknowledge of mathematics, science and engineering\nspecialization including Engineering Drawing,\nWorkshop Practice, Engineering Mechanics, Strength\nof Materials, Computer Application etc. Areas of\nsocial and economic concern like environmental\nprotection, energy conservation, productivity and\nquality, safety and entrepreneurial development are\nalso included. Some of the mandatory non-credit\ncourses like Cyber Security, Environment &\nEcology, and Indian Constitution are also included in\nthe course curriculum alongwith a general course on\ncomputer literacy and computer applications. Project\nwork is one of the mandatory courses, which is\nintended to provide opportunity for the students to\nPage 24/131 22-01-2023 05:45:28\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\ndevelop understanding of the inter relationship\nbetween courses and to apply the knowledge gained\nin a way that enables them to develop and\ndemonstrate higher order skills. Industry Institution\nInteraction is an integral component of the\ncurriculum. Program Elective and open elective\ncourses are offered to provide an opportunity for\nlimited specialization in an area of the students’\nchoice that cover new and emerging areas. There is\nalso the provision of awarding minor degree in some\nspecialization where students complete 4-5 additional\ncourses of 20 credits The University and its various\ndepartments/programs have well formulated vision\nand mission statements alongwith the Program\nEducational Objectives (PEOs) and Program Specific\nOutcomes (PSOs). Keeping in view the graduate\nattributes in the form of Program Outcomes (POs),\ncontent of every course has been formulated\nmeticulously by clearly delineating the appropriate\nnumber of Course Outcomes (COs). Suitable Course\nArticulation Matrix establishing relationship between\nCOs and POs as well as COs and PSOs have been\ncreated for various programs running in the\nUniversity. Attainment of COs and POs is ensured by\nformulating appropriate rubrics using direct methods\nwhich display the students’ knowledge and skills\nfrom their performance in the continuous internal\nassessment, end semester examinations, seminars and\nclassroom & laboratory assignments etc. and Indirect\nmethods such as surveys, feedback and opinion of the\nstakeholders reflecting the students’ learning.\nAttainment levels are finally analyzed to find out\ndeviations from the target values of the attainments\nand appropriate remedial measures are taken to meet\nout the target values if the deviations are towards the\nlower side. Process adopted for setting of question\npapers and the evaluation and assessment is as per the\nOBE framework.\n6. Distance education/online education: Effective learning requires a comprehensive approach\nthat involves appropriate curriculum, engaging\npedagogy, continuous formative assessment, and\nadequate student support along with suitable\nresources and infrastructure such as quality libraries,\nclassrooms, labs, technology, sports/recreation areas,\nstudent discussion spaces, and dining areas. To\nimprove the learning environment in sync with the\nglobal movement to integrate educational resources\nPage 25/131 22-01-2023 05:45:28\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nand increase the ease of accessibility to them while\nharnessing the powers of the global revolution,\nespecially through technological interventions,\nfollowing measures have been planned to be\nimplemented in due course of time: (a) Take\ninitiatives to ensure inclusive digital education by\ndevelopment and procurement of a rich variety of\neducational software, studios for content creation,\ndigital repository and dissemination, online\nteaching/assessment platforms and tools for the use\nby the students and teachers (b) Providing training to\nthe teachers on IT based infrastructure and high-\nquality online content creation (c) Ensure the\nintegration of technology based education platforms\nlike MOOCS, SWAYAM, NPTEL, CourseEra etc.,\nuse of the other channels such as television, radio,\nmass media and promotion of blended mode of\nteaching-learning (d) Creation of initial versions of\ninstructional materials and courses including online\ncourses in cutting-edge domains, virtual labs, a\ndigital repository of coursework, learning games and\nsimulations (e) Promotion of continuing education,\nawareness and extension activities through the use

We continue to serve to the best of our\nabilities by catering to the needs of industry and the society. Keeping pace with rapid changes in the\ntechnology and requirements of the industry, we have been continuously updating our curriculum.\nGovernment of Uttar Pradesh, by Act No. 11 of 2016, upgraded us to Harcourt Butler Technical University\non September 01, 2016 with the mandate to be a leading residential University and to become a Centre of\nExcellence with focus on research and development in the field of engineering, technology, science and\nhumanities. The University is spread across two campuses – the East Campus (77 acres) and the West\nCampus (251.8 acres) situated about 3 km apart in the very heart of Kanpur. We completed glorious 100\nyears on November 25, 2021 and the Centenary Celebration function was attended by the Hon’ble\nPresident of India.\nThe aim of the Curriculum Design and Development is to fulfill local, national, regional and global\ndevelopmental needs. Program Outcomes (POs), Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) and Course\nOutcomes (COs) of each course are meticulously stated and they are aligned with the vision and mission of\nthe University. The proposed program curriculum is thoroughly discussed in the meeting of Board of\nStudies (BoS) of the Department comprising of all faculty members, external domain experts and the\nrepresentatives of the alumni / students. Finally, this program curriculum is sent to the Academic Council\n(AC) of the University for approval. While revising the program curriculum, focus on employability /\nentrepreneurship / skill development of the students is given due importance. The Choice Based Credit\nSystem (CBCS) / Elective Course System was introduced in the erstwhile Institute to allow students to\nchoose courses from a basket of courses as per his / her choice and requirements. This basket is not limited\nto the courses listed in the syllabus whereas the students are free to choose courses from open online\nplatforms such as NPTEL, MOOCs etc., after due approval from competent authority. Courses on\nprofessional ethics, human values and environment are included in each program to inculcate professional\ntraits at workplace. Due weightage is accorded to the field projects / research projects / internships and\nvalue added courses for imparting knowledge, skill and real life problem solving ability.\nA feedback mechanism has been devised to include the views of all the stakeholders (students, teachers,\nemployers, alumni etc.) on curriculum design and development. This feedback is analyzed and appropriate\naction is taken to improve the syllabus. All the inputs are put before the BoS and semester-wise course\nstructure, evaluation scheme, Lecture-Tutorial-Practical (L-T-P) credits and syllabi of courses of a program\nare finalized after due deliberations. The process of curriculum revision and updation is done regularly as a\nmatter of policy. University is in the process of revision of course curriculum of all the degree programs to\nbe effective w.e.f. academic session 2022-23. Implementation of the program curriculum is strictly done by\nensuring the complete course coverage, examination and transparent evaluation system.\nPage 32/131 22-01-2023 05:45:28\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nFile Description Document\nUpload Additional information View Document\nLink for Additional information View Document\n1.1.2 Percentage of Programmes where syllabus revision was carried out during the last five years.\nResponse: 100\n1.1.2.1 How many Programmes were revised out of total number of Programmes offered during the\nlast five years\nResponse: 26\n1.1.2.2 Number of all Programmes offered by the institution during the last five years.\nResponse: 26\nFile Description Document\nMinutes of relevant Academic Council/BOS View Document\nmeeting\nInstitutional data in prescribed format View Document\nDetails of Programme syllabus revision in last 5 View Document\nyears\nAny additional information View Document\nLink for additional information View Document\n1.1.3 Average percentage of courses having focus on employability/ entrepreneurship/ skill\ndevelopment offered by the institution during the last five years\nResponse: 100\n1.1.3.1 Number of courses having focus on employability/ entrepreneurship/ skill development year-wise\nduring the last five years\n2021-22 2020-21 2019-20 2018-19 2017-18\n827 741 666 446 430\nPage 33/131 22-01-2023 05:45:28\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nFile Description Document\nProgramme/ Curriculum/ Syllabus of the courses View Document\nMoU's with relevant organizations for these courses, View Document\nif any\nMinutes of the Boards of Studies/ Academic View Document\nCouncil meetings with approvals for these courses\nInstitutional data in prescribed format View Document\nAny additional information View Document\n1.2 Academic Flexibility\n1.2.1 Percentage of new courses introduced of the total number of courses across all programs\noffered during the last five years.\nResponse: 53.57\n1.2.1.1 How many new courses were introduced within the last five years.\nResponse: 443\n1.2.1.2 Number of courses offered by the institution across all programmes during the last five years.\nResponse: 827\nFile Description Document\nMinutes of relevant Academic Council/BOS View Document\nmeeting\nInstitutional data in prescribed format View Document\nAny additional information View Document\n1.2.2 Percentage of Programmes in which Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) / elective course\nsystem has been implemented (Data for the latest completed academic year).\nResponse: 100\n1.2.2.1 Number of Programmes in which CBCS / Elective course system implemented.\nResponse: 26\nPage 34/131 22-01-2023 05:45:28\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nFile Description Document\nMinutes of relevant Academic Council/BOS View Document\nmeetings\nInstitutional data in prescribed format View Document\nAny additional information View Document\n1.3 Curriculum Enrichment\n1.3.1 Institution integrates crosscutting issues relevant to Professional Ethics ,Gender, Human\nValues ,Environment and Sustainability into the Curriculum\nResponse:\nOne of the Mission statements of the University reads ‘serving people, society and nation with the utmost\nprofessionalism, values and ethics to make development sustainable and quality of life.

For a course, we map the COs\nto POs through the CO-PO matrix and to PSOs through the CO-PSO matrix as shown below. The various\ncorrelation levels are:\n“1” – Slight (Low) Correlation\n“2” – Moderate (Medium) Correlation\n“3” – Substantial (High) Correlation\n“-”-- indicates there is no correlation.\nThere are four levels of outcome i.e., Course Outcome (CO), Program Outcome (PO), Program Specific\nOutcome (PSO) and Program Educational Objective (PEO).\nCourse Outcomes are the statements that declare what students should achieve at the end of a course. POs\nare predefined Graduate Attributes (GAs) related to the skills, knowledge and abilities of students beyond\ndisciplinary content knowledge, that are applicable in the range of contexts in their lives. GAs are the\ncomponents indicative of the graduate’s potential to acquire competence to practice at the appropriate\nlevel.\nThe Program Outcomes reflect the ability of graduates to demonstrate knowledge in fundamentals of Basic\nSciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Engineering Sciences and apply these principles in\nunderstanding and practically apply the knowledge in professional core subjects, electives and projects\nwhich enables the graduates to be competent at the time of graduation. The graduates must adhere to\nPage 50/131 22-01-2023 05:45:29\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nprofessional and ethical responsibilities in the pursuit of their careers and also for the benefit of society.\nThese outcomes also enable the graduates to pursue higher studies and engage in R&D for a successful\nprofessional career.\nProgram Specific Outcomes are the statements that assert what the graduates of a specific programme\nshould be able to do. Program Educational Objectives are the broad statements that describe in detail about\nthe career and professional accomplishments after significant years of graduation that the program prepare\nthe graduates to achieve.\nThe University makes assessments of the attainment of PO, PSO and CO for all programs. Course\nOutcomes along with their mapping with POs/PSOs are well defined for all the courses offered by the\nprogramme. Programme Articulation Matrix for POs/PSOs is created by taking course-wise average of all\nthe COs. Assessment tools to measure the students’ learning and hence attainment of COs are categorized\ninto direct and indirect methods. Direct methods display the students’ knowledge and skills from their\nperformance in the continuous internal assessment, semester examinations, seminars, and classroom &\nlaboratory assignments. Indirect method involves feedback from the outgoing students to reflect their\nlearning of various courses. Result analysis is made on the basis of the attainment of CO, PO and PSO.\nGap Analysis\nThe articulation matrix of COs with POs / PSOs is analyzed to find out the gaps. These gaps are bridged by\ncompensating for the observations that may include updating of curriculum, arranging invited lectures,\nworkshops and mentoring the students with other suitable measures as and when required.\nThe evaluation of COs is analyzed by the concerned faculty /Head and corrective measures are taken\naccordingly. Similarly, the attainment level of POs and PSOs are monitored, analyzed and corrected.\nFile Description Document\nUpload any additional information View Document\nPaste link for Additional Information View Document\n2.6.3 Pass Percentage of students(Data for the latest completed academic year)\nResponse: 93.36\n2.6.3.1 Total number of final year students who passed the examination conducted by Institution.\nResponse: 661\n2.6.3.2 Total number of final year students who appeared for the examination conducted by the\nInstitution.\nResponse: 708\nPage 51/131 22-01-2023 05:45:29\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nFile Description Document\nUpload list of Programmes and number of students View Document\npassed and appeared in the final year examination\nUpload any additional information View Document\nLink fo any additional information View Document\nPaste link for the annual report View Document\n2.7 Student Satisfaction Survey\n2.7.1 Online student satisfaction survey regarding teaching learning process\nResponse:\nFile Description Document\nUpload database of all currently enrolled students View Document\nPage 52/131 22-01-2023 05:45:29\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nCriterion 3 - Research, Innovations and Extension\n3.1 Promotion of Research and Facilities\n3.1.1 The institution's Research facilities are frequently updated and there is a well defined policy\nfor promotion of research which is uploaded on the institutional website and implemented\nResponse:\nHarcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur has a well-defined policy for the promotion of research\napproved by Executive Council of the University (apex body) which gets frequently updated at regular\nintervals.
