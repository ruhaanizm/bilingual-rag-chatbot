For a course, we map the COs\nto POs through the CO-PO matrix and to PSOs through the CO-PSO matrix as shown below. The various\ncorrelation levels are:\n“1” – Slight (Low) Correlation\n“2” – Moderate (Medium) Correlation\n“3” – Substantial (High) Correlation\n“-”-- indicates there is no correlation.\nThere are four levels of outcome i.e., Course Outcome (CO), Program Outcome (PO), Program Specific\nOutcome (PSO) and Program Educational Objective (PEO).\nCourse Outcomes are the statements that declare what students should achieve at the end of a course. POs\nare predefined Graduate Attributes (GAs) related to the skills, knowledge and abilities of students beyond\ndisciplinary content knowledge, that are applicable in the range of contexts in their lives. GAs are the\ncomponents indicative of the graduate’s potential to acquire competence to practice at the appropriate\nlevel.\nThe Program Outcomes reflect the ability of graduates to demonstrate knowledge in fundamentals of Basic\nSciences, Humanities and Social Sciences",
