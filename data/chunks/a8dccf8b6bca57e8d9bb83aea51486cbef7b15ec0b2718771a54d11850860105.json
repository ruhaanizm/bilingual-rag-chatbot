GAs are the\ncomponents indicative of the graduate’s potential to acquire competence to practice at the appropriate\nlevel.\nThe Program Outcomes reflect the ability of graduates to demonstrate knowledge in fundamentals of Basic\nSciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Engineering Sciences and apply these principles in\nunderstanding and practically apply the knowledge in professional core subjects, electives and projects\nwhich enables the graduates to be competent at the time of graduation. The graduates must adhere to\nPage 50/131 22-01-2023 05:45:29\nSelf Study Report of HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY\nprofessional and ethical responsibilities in the pursuit of their careers and also for the benefit of society.\nThese outcomes also enable the graduates to pursue higher studies and engage in R&D for a successful\nprofessional career.\nProgram Specific Outcomes are the statements that assert what the graduates of a specific programme\nshould be able to do. Program Educational Objectives are the broad statements that describe in detail about\nthe career and professional accomplishments after significant years of graduation that the program prepare\nthe graduates to achieve.\nThe University makes assessments of the attainment of PO, PSO and CO for all programs. Course\nOutcomes along with their mapping with POs/PSOs are well defined for all the courses offered by the\nprogramme. Programme Articulation Matrix for POs/PSOs is created by taking course-wise average of all\nthe COs. Assessment tools to measure the students’ learning and hence attainment of COs are categorized\ninto direct and indirect methods. Direct methods display the students’ knowledge and skills from their\nperformance in the continuous internal assessment, semester examinations, seminars, and classroom &\nlaboratory assignments. Indirect method involves feedback from the outgoing students to reflect their\nlearning of various courses. Result analysis is made on the basis of the attainment of CO, PO and PSO.\nGap Analysis\nThe articulation matrix of COs with POs / PSOs is analyzed to find out the gaps. These gaps are bridged by\ncompensating for the observations that may include updating of curriculum, arranging invited lectures,\nworkshops and mentoring the students with other suitable measures as and when required.\nThe evaluation of COs is analyzed by the concerned faculty /Head and corrective measures are taken\naccordingly. Similarly, the attainment level of POs and PSOs are monitored, analyzed and corrected.\nFile Description Document\nUpload any additional information View",
